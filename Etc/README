This directory contains passwd & group files, as used by the pwd.py and 
grp.py modules.  The pwd.pyd dynamically loadable module uses the EMX 
library's emulation of the unix routines, which synthesizes the info 
with no reference to any data file.

These versions of these files use the OS/2 standard path delimiter (";") 
as the field separator, rather than the unix standard ":".  This means 
that all paths in these files don't need bizarre conversions to support 
drive letters.

If you have other software that insists on a different variation, the 
supplied pwd and grp modules handle several variations.  Refer to the 
module docstrings for the details.
